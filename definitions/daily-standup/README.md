# Definition of the Daily Standup

> _“Dreams are, by definition, cursed with short life spans.”_
> ~ Candice Bergen

## Introduction

Standup is a thing we use to inform each other on blockers or impediments. 
We use this to share information and quickly interfere if someone needs / might 
need help. We excluded the Product Owners from the stand-up (for now). 

The product Owners can "stand (up)" with us but are not allowed to ask for updates. 
Post updates are allowed in the line of "I am demoing FEATURE to 
stakeholders or other progress.

## Guidelines

![Definition of Daily Standup](../../images/definitions/definition-of-standup.jpg)

- Standup is optional!

- There is no obligation of speaking at all, don't say something just to say something.

- Information shared should not be present on the whiteboard
(I am going to shutdown the test environment for instance).

- Impediments should be discussed so people can help solve them.

- If you do mention what you are going to do, make sure the reason for that is to avoid 
people doing the same work as you are going to do. (Globally on feature or request level)
