# Developer Pain Criteria

The criteria we use to define [developer pain](../) are:

| Little Effort              | Much Effort             | Note                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Change Existing Feature    | Create New Feature      |                                                                                                                            |
| Easy Work                  | Hard Work               | Will the work take a lot of effort and sweat or will you be whistling while you go?                                        |
| Few Resources Required     | Many Resources Required | Can a single developer resolve the issue by themselves or are several developer needed?                                    |
| High Quality Code          | Low Quality Code        | Is the code all shiny and new or rotten and broken?                                                                        |
| Knowledge Present          | Knowledge Missing       | Is the knowledge needed to resolve the issue available (documentation, system knowledge, domain knowledge, etc.)?          |
| No Technical Design Needed | Technical Design Needed | Can the issue be implemented without influencing existing architecture or does a new plan need to be made?                 |
| Small Scope                | Large Scope             | Is the scope of the issue limited to a single place in the code-base or does it span multiple places in multiple projects? |
| Stupid Production Work     | Smart Thinking Work     | Is the work simplistic or does it require constant vigilance?                                                              |
