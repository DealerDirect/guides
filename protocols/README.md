# Protocols

> _“Anyone who considers protocol unimportant has never dealt with a cat.”_
> ~ Robert A. Heinlein

This guide defines various protocols we use at Dealerdirect. The intent of this 
guide is to help people understand what is expected of them and what they can 
expect from others.

Protocols are available for the following scenario's:

## Development Process 

- [Deliverables](./development-process/deliverables/) -- Outlines who is 
 responsible for providing which deliverable during the software development 
 process.
 
- [Work Approach Checklist](./development-process/work-approach-checklist/) -- Outlines who is 
 responsible for providing which deliverable during the software development 
 process.
